        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <h4>For the chicken:</h4>
        <ol> 
           <li>Place the boiled and shredded chicken in a medium bowl. Add salt, black pepper and mayonnaise. Mix well and set aside.
           </li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>For the omelet:</h4>
        <ol>   
           <li>Whisk the eggs in a small bowl and add salt as well as black pepper.</li>
           <li>Heat oil in a frying pan and add the whisked egg in batches to make a thin crepe style omelette. In a medium sized egg, this will result in 3 omelets, and in a large frying pan, this will result in 2 omelets. Cut the omelet into 4 parts, enough to cover 4 slices of bread.
           </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>For the club sandwich assembly:</h4>
          <ol>
           <li>Trim the edges of the bread, if desired.Dont throw the edges away. They can be used to make breadcrumbs.</li>
           <li>Apply a thin layer of butter on each bread slice, and toast them on a pan on each side until brown.It is also possible to toast the bread slices in a sandwich press or toaster oven.</li>
           <li>Each sandwich consists of 3 slices of bread. </li>
           <li>Start off with spreading mayonnaise and tomato sauce on the first slice, and then top with the chicken spread.</li>
           <li>Top the second slice with mayonnaise and tomato sauce, then add lettuce leaves, sliced cucumber, sliced tomato, followed by the egg slice and cheese slice (if using).</li>
           <li>To assemble, place the first slice with the chicken on the bottom, then the second slice with the vegetables and egg, and then top off with the third slice.</li>
           <li>Press the club sandwich carefully so that the layers join together, and then place a toothpick through the sandwich so the layers dont separate. Cut into quarters or halves using a bread knife or serrated knife.</li>
           <li>Serve with coleslaw, French fries and tomato sauce / tomato ketchup. This recipe makes 4 sandwiches, and nutrition is based on one person consuming one sandwich easily. In the event of a high-tea party, the serving size would be less.</li>
