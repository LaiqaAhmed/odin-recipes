            This chicken club sandwich recipe is super easy to put together and makes for a perfect snack, lunch or dinner. This recipe is based on the Pakistani style club sandwich that is served in cafes and restaurants across the country. The first layer is chicken mixed with mayonnaise, followed by a layer of lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber along with a thin omelet and cheese. Serve with French fries or wedges, and coleslaw.
