        <p>This style of French fries are also called masala fries or thelay walay fries in India and Pakistan. The word thela means roadside stall and these spicy chili French fries are sold at roadside stalls around the country. The special thing about these fries is that they are tossed in a spicy and tangy spice blend, also called a masala. The French fries are then doused with ketchup that is more sweet than tangy. You get the crispness of the fries, the spice from the masala, and the sweetness from the ketchup all in one bite. The masala is hot, and it can make your lips burn, but its so addictive that you cant stop eating.</p>
