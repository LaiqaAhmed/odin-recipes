<p>This style of French fries are also called masala fries or thelay walay fries in India and Pakistan. The word thela means roadside stall and these spicy chili French fries are sold at roadside stalls around the country. The special thing about these fries is that they are tossed in a spicy and tangy spice blend, also called a masala. The French fries are then doused with ketchup that is more sweet than tangy. You get the crispness of the fries, the spice from the masala, and the sweetness from the ketchup all in one bite. The masala is hot, and it can make your lips burn, but its so addictive that you cant stop eating.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chaat masala, red chili powder, dried mango powder and salt in a medium sized bowl. Mix the spice mix and set aside.</li>
        <li>To make fresh French fries: Peel the potatoes. Wash and cut into French fries. Soak the sliced potatoes in water, and let them sit for about 5 to 10 minutes. This step removes the excess starch in potatoes. Drain the potatoes, and lightly pat dry. Heat the oil in a karahi, wok or shallow frying on medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is ready, add the sliced potatoes and fry till the potatoes are golden brown in colour.</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon to remove the fries from the hot oil, and place them on kitchen towel to drain the oil.</li>
        <li>Serve the spicy chili French fries / masala fries hot with ketchup and chai.</li>
